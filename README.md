# Causal inference/discovery over time-series data by using random forest

Time series data consist of ordered sequences of real-valued  data which are often collected over time. With the rapid  growth of time series data generated by different domains  such as financial, medical, and neuroscience  applications, various approaches have been developed.  Questions such as: Was an enforced policy effective? or  Which medicine works better for a specific disease? are crucial questions that can help decision making. In order to answer such questions with data, one needs to  estimate the effect of an intervention/treatment.  The task of estimating such  effects from the data is called causal treatment effect estimation. Causal treatment effect estimation is one the most  important tasks in causal inference which leverages concepts  from causality to estimate this effect from the data. 
The goal of the project is to explore  treatment effect over time estimation by extending random forest.

It is an ongoing project still in initial stages
